    <h1>The Director - Composer Pair</h1>

    <p>Sessions will revolve around three things: topics of ‘ways of thinking’ about the use of music in film; attendees’ own current film projects; and exemplary films for illustration. Articles can be included, though this is not an academic scenario—we will be discussing only the artistic pragmatics of the use of music in film.</p>

    <p>The deployment of music in a film depends on the way the Director thinks. Not the end-decisions they make, but the way they think about film. The way they think about how sound and film fuse to create effects of dramatic meaning.</p>

    <p>In general, the responsibility of the Director, i.e., the Creative Director of the film, is not to know the skills of each department—this only hampers all parties—but the possibilities of the meaningful use of those skills for dramatic expression.</p>

    <p>The biggest struggle is for a Director to find their own language, and their own way of communicating it. They need to find their own language to facilitate the artistry of their skilled departmental artists, to bring an entire audio-vision to life. This includes a process of becoming able to use metaphor and analogy in a personal way—e.g., using physical and spatial language as metaphors for sonic process and dramatic meaning. While musical terminology is vital for any Director—simply in general, given that film is a flow organized in time—the last thing a Director should do with any department is talk in terms of specific technical skill—e.g., ‘transpose here’—as applied to the medium in question. e.g., telling an actor how to act, telling a costumier how to do the stitches. That will only result in a reactive craftsperson, not a spontaneous artist.</p>

    <p><strong>The use of music will reinterpret the film.</strong> Sam Mendes: <em>‘A film is written four times: script, shoot, edit, score’</em>. By using music in a film, including not using it at all, the entire film is completely redescribed; its meaning changed, subverted, or enhanced.</p>

    <h2>Key Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>How does the nature of the soundscape express the drama?</li>
        <li>How does the use of music express the drama?</li>
        <li>Why is music present? Why must it not be present?</li>
        <li>How is the music relevant? (If it is irrelevant, it has no place.)</li>
        <li>When it is relevant, how is it relevant?</li>
        <li>How is the music metaphoric? A metaphor for what? The character? Their feelings? Their memory? Their struggle? The ideas of the narrative world?</li>
        <li>Where does the music ‘come from’ in the narrative?</li>
        <li>What meaning could stylistic precedent lend the narrative?</li>
        <li>Will you consciously or even overtly parody, or subtly incorporate, stylistic precedent?</li>
        <li>How are existing songs and score related to each other? Are they different at all?</li>
        <li>Will the score dovetail musically with songs, or ignore them?</li>
        <li>What is the score & songs’ respective dramatic function in the narrative—both emotionally and formally? If songs are recognizable, what does that alone express?</li>
        <li>How does score instrumentation relate to the nature of the drama at hand?</li>
        <li>Why would melody be appropriate or inappropriate? Would leitmotif be relevant?</li>
        <li>What transformative effects can be applied to music to synchronize and elaborate narrative meaning?</li>
        <li>What is the purpose of music in this film? Why use music? (It may not be required.)</li>
        <li>How is genre reflected in the stylistic choices of score and songs?</li>
        <li>How could the score follow or negate the dramatic flow? Why create counterpoint?</li>
        <li>What will your scoring pragmatic process be? How will you inspire a composer?</li>
        <li>Will you develop some of the score before the edit, before the shoot, in pre-production, so as to have score already available to the edit to edit with?</li>
        <li>How will you communicate your vision to your composer?</li>
        <li>Do you know how to score film? If not, does the composer? (Writing music does not mean writing film-music.)</li>
        <li>Can you speak in metaphoric, emotional, psychological, dramatic language?</li>
        <li>How should you mix score in scenes? How will you use music to elide and delineate scenes, sequences, and acts? What dramatic reasons underlie such decisions?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sessions</h2>
    <p>The distinction between a full semester session and a one-night masterclass can be a condensation and expansion of the same material.</p>
    <p>Any of these could be done over Zoom—but it is always best to do it in person. The nature and aliveness of creative elaboration is always a function of each person’s experience of the space between the people involved.</p>
