    <h1>The Composer - Director Unit</h1>

    <p>The topic revolves around three things: ‘ways of thinking’ about the use of music in film; attendees’ own current film projects; and exemplary films for illustration. Articles can be included, though this is not an academic scenario—we will be discussing only the artistic pragmatics of the use of music in film.</p>

    <p>The deployment of music in a film depends on the way the Director thinks about the use and purpose and function of music in film. Not the end-decisions they make, but the way they think about film. The way they think about how sound and film fuse to create effects of dramatic meaning.</p>

    <p>The most common struggle for a Director is finding their own language, and their own way of communicating it. They need to find their own language to facilitate the artistry of their skilled departmental artists, to bring an entire audio-vision to life.</p>

    <p><strong>The use of music reinterprets the film.</strong> Sam Mendes: <em>‘A film is written four times: script, shoot, edit, score’</em>. By using music in a film, including not using it at all, the entire film is completely redescribed; its meaning changed, subverted, or enhanced.</p>

    <h2>Key Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>How does the nature of the soundscape express the drama?</li>
        <li>How does the use of music express the drama?</li>
        <li>Why is music present? Why must it not be present?</li>
        <li>How is the music relevant? (If it is irrelevant, it has no place.)</li>
        <li>What is the purpose of music in this film?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sessions</h2>
    <p>The distinction between a full semester session and a one-night masterclass can be a condensation and expansion of the same material.</p>
    <p>Any of these could be done over Zoom—but it is always best to do it in person. The nature and aliveness of creative elaboration is always a function of each person’s experience of the space between the people involved.</p>
